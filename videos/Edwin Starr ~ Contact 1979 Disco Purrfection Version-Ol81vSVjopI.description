Edwin Starr was born January 21, 1942 in Nashville, Tennessee. Spending his formative years in Ohio, he finally relocated to Detroit, Michigan when the Motown machine ruled the music world with an iron fist. Hatcher's first offcial release was to very cool sounding #21 hit "Agent Double-O-Soul" in 1965 on the Ric-Tic Label. After about six singles on that label, he was signed to Motown and immediately released "I Want My Baby Back" in 1967, a cover of the 1965 Jimmy Cross hit. Ric-Tic released one last single "You're My Mellow" in 1967. He began singing protest songs and "Twenty Five Miles" peaked at #6 in 1969 but his biggest hit, the anti-war single "War" came from Motown and was his first #1 pop hit. After 1971's "Stop the War Now" made it to #26 and is his last pop charting. He moved to the UK in 1973 and continued recording and releasing a series of R&B hits and then testing the disco waters with the testosterone driven "Contact" that absolutely declared its lustful intentions with Edwin's soulful and fiery vocals making it glow with energy and passion making it a #1 disco hit for the week ending January 13, 1979  peaking at #65 pop US. "H.A.P.P.Y. Radio" was the official follow up from 20th Century Records and it gave Starr his second UK top 10 hit, after "Contact". He kept recording and sporadically released more albums, and joined up with high energy producer Ian Levine for a series of singles. At the age of 61, he passed away from a heart attack on April 2, 2003.
