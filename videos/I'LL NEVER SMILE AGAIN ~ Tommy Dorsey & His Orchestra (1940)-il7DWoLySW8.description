I'LL NEVER SMILE AGAIN ~ Tommy Dorsey & His Orchestra ~ Frank Sinatra w/ The Pied Pipers (1940)  Victor Records #26628

Ruth Lowe, one time pianist with Ina Ray Huttons all-girl orchestra, was inspired to write "I'LL NEVER SMILE AGAIN" following the death of her husband, Harold Cohen, after only a few months of marriage.

This recording was made in New York on May 23, 1940. The Pied Pipers consisted of Jo Stafford, John Huddleston, Clark Yocum, & Chuck Lowry. Trumpeter, Bunny Berigan, and drummer, Buddy Rich, were both apart of the Dorsey Orchestra at the time this recording was made.
Glenn Miller, while on the Bluebird label, was the first to record, I'll Never Smile Again, but not much became of the recording, which was surprising, since anything Miller touched, normally became an instant success at that time. I, happily, found a vg+ 78 rpm copy of the Miller Bluebird recording of I'll Never Smile Again, sitting in a stack of worn out Bennett, Laine, & Peggy Lee records. I paid 25 cents for it, which was the same price I had paid for the Tommy Dorsey version of the same song, a few weeks earlier, at the same second hand store. Though the Dorsey version does have a slight edge on Miller's, I wouldn't part with either record for anything. I'll Never Smile Again, really is, a great song.
