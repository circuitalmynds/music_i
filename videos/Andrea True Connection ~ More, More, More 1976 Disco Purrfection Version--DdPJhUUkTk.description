"More, More, More" was disco's calling card. At the time the burgeoning disco scene was well on its way to juggernaut status along with the 50's and 60's nostalgia craze that would crest with the movie version of "Grease" in 1978. I used to work as a bagboy during 1976, and I had to open Sunday mornings. We were a two car family, so I got to take the 1974 Gran Torino Squire station wagon to work. WDRQ, my favorite 70's radio station, had a sunday morning show with an inspirational religious bent helmed by DJ Paul Nicholas, who basically preached between Top 40 records. He was able to explain that "More, More, More" could mean making yourself closer to the Lord. Early in the disco era, there were many themes in common with religion, such as community, communion and salvation, all of which you could experience on the dance floor,  the same gospel release as you threw off the yoke of your problems and shook your ass way into the night. The sly lyrics of "More, More, More" included an in joke in the line "so get the cameras rollin', get the action going" that played on Andrea's pornographic past but also tapped into the "just do it" disco fever that everyone seemed to have. Its been a long time coming to put out my special stamp on this one, I really loved the original and the feelings it now elicits about my youth, with all the energy and hope I could handle.
