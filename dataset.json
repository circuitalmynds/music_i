        "description": "One of my favourite Hank Williams songs. Hank recorded this track on 30 August 1949 in Ohio. With him were ace studio musicians: Zeke Turner (electric guitar), Louis Innes (rhythm guitar), Jerry Byrd (steel guitar), Ernie Newton (bass), and Tommy Jackson (fiddle). They were not part of the Drifting Cowboys who toured with Hank at that time (although a couple did do stints with them). The Drifting Cowboys did record with Hank on many other sessions. \n\nAccording to Colin Escott who wrote a biography on Hank \"Here is the chill of the void that would become one of the hallmarks of Hank's writing. It is the most oft cited example of Hank Williams the hillbilly poet, but its poetic form comes from the fact that it was originally intended to be spoken, not sung. Acuff-Rose staff writer Vic McAlpin said that Hank had written it for his first session of recitations slated for January 1950, but at some point he changed his mind. \"I think ol' Hank needs to record this,\" he told McAlpin. Hank was concerned that some of the lines might sound self-consciously artsy and alienate his audience, but, as he so often did, he tried out the song on friends, fellow performers, and Fred Rose, and let them convince him that he had excelled\".\n\nVeteran Nashville songwriter Jimmy Rule recalls: \"One day I was over at Acuff-Rose, our mutual publisher, and Hank handed me a piece of paper and said, \"Do you think people will understand what I'm trying to say when I say this?\" The line was 'Did you ever see a robin weep when leaves begin to die? It's because he's lost the will to live; I'm so lonesome I could cry'. Hank had this lonesome streak, and I think it was largely caused by his marital problems. I think he wrote it out of a feeling of loneliness that stayed very much with him. He would be the natural person to write 'I'm so lonesome I could cry'.\" \n\nI have done my own slideshow video of this song, using as many images of Hank singing that I could find. Also included a few images of the musicians who played on this session, Jerry Byrd and Tommy Jackson. I hope that people not into Hank might take the time to explore his music.",

        "description": "\"More, More, More\" was disco's calling card. At the time the burgeoning disco scene was well on its way to juggernaut status along with the 50's and 60's nostalgia craze that would crest with the movie version of \"Grease\" in 1978. I used to work as a bagboy during 1976, and I had to open Sunday mornings. We were a two car family, so I got to take the 1974 Gran Torino Squire station wagon to work. WDRQ, my favorite 70's radio station, had a sunday morning show with an inspirational religious bent helmed by DJ Paul Nicholas, who basically preached between Top 40 records. He was able to explain that \"More, More, More\" could mean making yourself closer to the Lord. Early in the disco era, there were many themes in common with religion, such as community, communion and salvation, all of which you could experience on the dance floor,  the same gospel release as you threw off the yoke of your problems and shook your ass way into the night. The sly lyrics of \"More, More, More\" included an in joke in the line \"so get the cameras rollin', get the action going\" that played on Andrea's pornographic past but also tapped into the \"just do it\" disco fever that everyone seemed to have. Its been a long time coming to put out my special stamp on this one, I really loved the original and the feelings it now elicits about my youth, with all the energy and hope I could handle.",

The Pied Pipers consisted of Jo Stafford, John Huddleston, Clark Yocum, & Chuck Lowry. Trumpeter, Bunny Berigan, and drummer, Buddy Rich, were both apart of the Dorsey Orchestra at the time this recording was made.\nGlenn Miller, while on the Bluebird label, was the first to record, I'll Never Smile Again, but not much became of the recording, which was surprising, since anything Miller touched, normally became an instant success at that time. I, happily, found a vg+ 78 rpm copy of the Miller Bluebird recording of I'll Never Smile Again, sitting in a stack of worn out Bennett, Laine, & Peggy Lee records. I paid 25 cents for it, which was the same price I had paid for the Tommy Dorsey version of the same song, a few weeks earlier, at the same second hand store. Though the Dorsey version does have a slight edge on Miller's, I wouldn't part with either record for anything. I'll Never Smile Again, really is, a great song.",

CGP is an artist-led gallery founded in 1984 by The Bermondsey Artists' Group. \n\nThey commission major artworks by artists at all stages of their career. It's a vital part of London's art scene offering space and support that no-one else can across two stunning galleries. \n\nIts an amazing cavernous raw space that hosts a lot of performance, music and live art. They rent it out in between shows to get the crucial funding they need to keep supporting artists. There's nowhere quite like it!\n\nDilston is one of the first poured concrete structures in the UK, built in 1909 by Cambridge University. It had been derelict since the 60s until the gallery took it on.

        "description": "Edwin Starr was born January 21, 1942 in Nashville, Tennessee. Spending his formative years in Ohio, he finally relocated to Detroit, Michigan when the Motown machine ruled the music world with an iron fist. Hatcher's first offcial release was to very cool sounding #21 hit \"Agent Double-O-Soul\" in 1965 on the Ric-Tic Label. After about six singles on that label, he was signed to Motown and immediately released \"I Want My Baby Back\" in 1967, a cover of the 1965 Jimmy Cross hit. Ric-Tic released one last single \"You're My Mellow\" in 1967. He began singing protest songs and \"Twenty Five Miles\" peaked at #6 in 1969 but his biggest hit, the anti-war single \"War\" came from Motown and was his first #1 pop hit. After 1971's \"Stop the War Now\" made it to #26 and is his last pop charting. He moved to the UK in 1973 and continued recording and releasing a series of R&B hits and then testing the disco waters with the testosterone driven \"Contact\" that absolutely declared its lustful intentions with Edwin's soulful and fiery vocals making it glow with energy and passion making it a #1 disco hit for the week ending January 13, 1979  peaking at #65 pop US. \"H.A.P.P.Y. Radio\" was the official follow up from 20th Century Records and it gave Starr his second UK top 10 hit, after \"Contact\". He kept recording and sporadically released more albums, and joined up with high energy producer Ian Levine for a series of singles. At the age of 61, he passed away from a heart attack on April 2, 2003.",
